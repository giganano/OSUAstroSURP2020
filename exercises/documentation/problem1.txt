Moderate Problem: Plotting Mathematical Functions with Matplotlib 

This is an exercise in traversing matplotlib's documentation, which can be 
quite confusing if you're relatively new to python or inexperienced in 
reading documentation. 

Produce a plot of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions in black, red, and 
blue, respectively, with x-axis limits 0 to 2pi, and y-axis limits -2 to 2. 
Place a legend in the lower left corner, and remove the gray box bounding the 
legend (you may need to produce the figure without this modification once to 
see what its referring to). Use a subplot to do so rather than calling 
pyplot.plot directly, and label the x- and y-axes simply with "x" and "y". 
Save the figure as both a PDF and a PNG. 

Hint: To create a subplot, first make a figure by calling pyplot.figure, and 
then a subplot can be created with fig.add_subplot. The names of some functions 
change when called for a subplot; for example, plt.xlabel changes to 
ax.set_label for a subplot ax. For those who haven't created such figures 
before, a perpetually continuous plot of a function can be made by simply 
plotting ~1000 points at different x-values.
