Challenge Problem: Sinusoids 

Write a class which implements a sinusoid. 

Correct solutions will have four properties - "amplitude", "frequency", 
"phase", and "angular_frequency". These should have property and setter 
functions with error handling. The amplitude should only allow non-negative 
values, and the frequency should only allow positive values. The phase can 
allow any value. Modifications to the angular_frequency property should also 
automatically modify the frequency property, and vice versa. 

Make this class callable by the value x alone (i.e. example(1) should return 
the value of the sinusoid at x = 1).
