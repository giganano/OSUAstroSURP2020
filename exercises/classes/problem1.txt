Moderate Problem: Exponential Growth and Decay 

Write a class which implements exponential growth and decay. (Hint: you don't 
need to treat growth and decay separately here). 

Correct solutions will have two two properties - "normalization" and "rate". 
The normalization describes the value of the exponential at x = 0, and rate 
describes the e-folding length in units of the x-coordinate. These attribute 
should have property and setter functions with error handling. Correct 
solutions will have a default value of 1 for both of these attributes. 

Make this class callable by the value x alone (i.e. example(1) should return 
the value of the exponential at x = 1).
