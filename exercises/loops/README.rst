Exercise: Loops 
===============

Problem 1a
----------
Write an explicit for loop which conducts the following operation for the 
numbers 1 through 100. The program should print the number itself, and it 
raised to the second, third, fourth, and fifth power on the same line. 

Hint: This only requires two lines. 



Problem 1b
----------
Starting with a copy of your code from problem 1a, modify it such that the 
powers 1 through 5 are generated by an implicit for loop. 

Note: This will require inserting a list comprehension. 



Problem 1c 
----------
Replicate your solution to problem 1b with a while loop. 



Problem 2
---------
Print a multiplication table for the numbers 1 through 10. Use format 
specifiers in your print statement to make the numbers print with even 
spacing.
