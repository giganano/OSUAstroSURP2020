Simple Problem: File I/O with simple conditionals 

a) Write a program which records in an output file the numbers 1 through 
10,000, the square of each number, and if it is odd, its cube as well. Use a 
while loop to do this, and do not use numpy.savetxt. 

b) Write a program which reads in the file you generated in part (a) and store 
the output in a 2-D list. You will not be able to use numpy.genfromtxt for 
this problem because the file is not square (hint: you will probably want to 
make use of the "split" function for strings). Print the first 20 elements of 
the 2-D list to make sure everything came out right.
