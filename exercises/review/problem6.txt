Moderate Problem: A Fibonacci Generator 

The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the n'th element is 
the sum of the two prior elements, with the first two being 0 and 1. 

a) Write a function which generates the first N elements of the Fibonacci 
Sequence. Correct solutions will accept the value of N as a parameter, will 
raise a TypeError if N is not an integer, and a ValueError if it is less than 
2, and will return the Fibonacci Sequence as either a list or numpy array. 

b) Write a new function which prints the list returned from the function you 
wrote in part (a) with each number separated by a space. Hint: This can be 
done by using sys.stdout.write in place of the print function, which does not 
print on a new line with each call to the function. 

Bonus: This print format can also be achieved in one line by passing the 
list returned from your function part(a) to the print function and adding only 
one extra character. 

c) Expand your script to accept the number of elements of the Fibonacci 
Sequence as a command line argument. Use this to print the first 20 elements 
of the Fibonacci Sequence. The last number printed should be 4181.
