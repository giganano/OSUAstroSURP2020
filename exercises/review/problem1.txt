Simple Problem: File I/O with randomly generated numbers. 

a) Write a program which pseudo-randomly generates 10,000 numbers according to 
a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation of 1 (hint: you can use 
numpy.random.normal to do exactly this). Write these to an output file, with 
each number on its own line. 

b) Write a program which reads in the file you wrote in part (a). Use 
numpy.std to check that the standard deviation is reasonably close to 1. 


Brownie points go to those who write their file I/O code without using numpy.
