Moderate Problem: Basic Recursion 

Recursive functions are functions that call themselves. Developers talk about 
two cases when it comes to recursive functions - the base case and the 
recursive case. The base case is the one which does not call the function, and 
instead returns some value. The recursive case returns a line which calls the 
function itself, and this continues until the base case is reached, and a 
value can be returned. 

a) A simple yet classic example of recursion is a factorial function. Recall 
that this is defined by 0! = 1 and n! = n(n - 1)!. Write a function which uses 
recursion to calculate n! for a given value of n. Bonus: raise a ValueError if 
n is negative, and write a docstring for this function. 

b) Use your function from part a to print the factorial of the numbers 1 
through 50, and use string formatters to place the integers in the print 
statement.
