Moderate Problem: Add a directory to your Path 

Modify your bash profile or your bash rc to add a directory to your PATH. When 
you're done, you'll know if it worked based on whether the command 'echo $PATH' 
prints the directory you added along with many other directories, separated 
by colons. 

If you accidentally wipe out the other directories from your path, you can fix 
this by removing the line you added to your bash profile/rc and restarting 
your terminal. 

Hint: PATH and PYTHONPATH are just special environment variables. Their 
assignment proceeds in a similar fashion. 

Note: Don't forget to run 'source ~/.bash_profile' (or 'source ~/.bashrc', 
depending on which file you choose to modify) after making the modification.
