Simple Problem: Create an environment variable 

Modify your bash profile or bash rc to create an environment variable. When 
you're done, you'll know if it worked based on whether the command 
'echo $(name of your environment variable)' prints what you set it to. 

Note: Don't forget to run 'source ~/.bash_profile' (or 'source ~/.bashrc', 
depending on which file you choose to modify) after making the modification.
