Tools 
=====
This is a synopsis of the tools you'll need if you're participating in this 
bootcamp. 


* A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) 
	Many astronomers now write a majority of their python code in Jupyter 
	Notebooks. However, notebooks are restrictive in that code is not easily 
	shared between multiple files. This is much easier when the code is 
	written in plain text files with the extension ``.py``; python code written 
	in this format can also be imported into your Jupyter Notebooks. 

	An IDE differs from a text editor in that the IDE has the capability to 
	run your code, and usually also provides an ``ipython`` interface. Popular 
	options are `Spyder`__ (included with `Anaconda`__), `PyCharm`__, and 
	the Python Foundation's own IDE `IDLE`__. If you choose to work with an 
	IDE rather than a text editor, beware that some have the added downside 
	of being dedicated to a specific language. 

	You're welcome to use whichever text editor or IDE you please for this 
	bootcamp. If you do not have one or don't have a preference in the matter, 
	my personal favorite is `Sublime Text`__.

* A bash terminal 
	There are various forms of command-line interpreters, but they all fit into 
	one of two categories: Unix-derived and DOS-derived. Microsoft's PowerShell 
	is an example of a DOS-derived command line, whereas Linux operating 
	systems as well as the Mac OS are derived from Unix. On Linux, the dominant 
	command line is the Bourne Again SHell (bash). Bash is extended by the 
	Z SHell (ZSH), which is the default interpreter on the Mac OS since 
	Catalina. There are `some minor differences between Bash and ZSH`__, though 
	Mac OS allows users to revert to a bash default. 

	If you're a Windows user, I recommend upgrading to Windows 10 version 
	>= 18362.0 if you haven't already, and downloading the `Windows Terminal`__ 
	from the Microsoft Store. This is an open-source, fully integrated Linux 
	environment within Windows with a bash command line interpreter; other 
	terminal utilities in Windows use PowerShell, the DOS-derived command 
	line with different syntax. Astronomy is dominated by Linux and Mac OS, and 
	thus also the bash terminal. For these reasons, if you're new to the 
	command line, I recommand focusing your efforts on learning bash rather 
	than PowerShell syntax. 

	If you're a Mac OS user, I recommend `iTerm2`__ over the built-in terminal 
	application, because it allows much more customization of the user 
	interface.
