Print Statements 
================ 
Print statements do exactly what the name would suggest - print something to 
the console. These aren't limited to words. You can print numbers, lists of 
numbers, functions, objects, etc. 

Despite their simplicity, print statements are among the most useful features 
in programming. They play an indispensible role in debugging, because they're 
how we inspect our variables and the behavior of our code as it progresses 
to find errors.
