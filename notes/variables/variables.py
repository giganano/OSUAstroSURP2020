""" 
Variables 
========= 
Variables are objects that you've given a name. This allows you to store 
data in memory, and access it elsewhere in the code. 

Variables can have any name, and can be assigned to anything. However, it is a 
bad idea to give variables the same name as a python built-in, as it will 
override the built-in function. For example, naming a variable 'print' would 
cause the print function to disappear, because it now corresponds to a 
variable. 
""" 

""" 
Variables can be created with a simple delcaratory statement with the equal 
sign. In all coding, = is not a mathematical statement, instead serving as 
the assignment operator. It tells the computer to store a value in memory and 
what to recognized it as.
